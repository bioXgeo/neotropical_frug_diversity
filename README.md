# Project Title
Spatial alignment and mismatch of taxonomic and functional diversity of frugivorous species in the Tropical Andes

# Project Summary
The Tropical Andes is known for its remarkable biological richness and diversity, making it a crucial focal point for biodiversity conservation. However, this region faces significant anthropogenic pressures such as habitat loss and climate change. Conservation efforts often concentrate on protecting areas with high taxonomic diversity (TD), overlooking the essential roles played by species that contribute to ecosystem functioningâ€“ functional diversity (FD). To ensure comprehensive conservation priorities, a broader perspective considering various dimensions of diversity is necessary. Here, we utilized the Frugivoria trait database to evaluate the functional diversity of frugivorous birds and mammals, which perform the vital role of seed dispersal, an essential ecosystem service necessary to maintain forest structure and ecosystem health. We examined the spatial mismatch between taxonomic and functional diversity across peak diversity thresholds (highest 10, 20, and 30%). Our findings revealed disparities between the highest levels of FD and TD, emphasizing the limitations of relying solely on TD for conservation. This highlights the need for a more holistic conservation approach that considers multiple facets of diversity. Nevertheless, some congruence between taxonomic and functional diversity emerged for mammals and birds, highlighting potential areas for multidimensional biodiversity conservation. Additionally, we examined the distribution of Functionally Unique, Specialized, and Endangered (FUSE) species and their protection status across strict and less strict protected areas. Stricter protected zones exhibited better coverage of FUSE species distributions, though instances of unprotected high FUSE species richness were observed. Further, we also noted the high level of protection of FUSE species within Indigenous Lands and areas under community management. As global conservation goals target the protection of 30% of the Earth's land by 2030, our study provides insights into integrating diverse dimensions of biodiversity into spatial conservation strategies. By shedding light on these complex interactions and the varying degrees of protection, our work contributes to future informed decision-making and underscores the importance of collaborative partnerships with local communities, ensuring effective and sustainable conservation strategies within the Tropical Andes.
